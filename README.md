## Introduction

Rails Pulse is a comprehensive performance monitoring and debugging gem that provides real-time insights into your Rails application's health. Built as a Rails Engine, it seamlessly integrates with your existing application to capture, analyze, and visualize performance metrics without impacting your production workload.

**Why Rails Pulse?**

- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance overhead in production
- **Comprehensive**: Monitors requests, database queries, and application operations
- **Visual**: Beautiful, responsive dashboards with actionable insights
- **Real-time**: Live performance metrics and health scoring

Rails Pulse helps you identify performance bottlenecks, track response times, monitor database query performance, and maintain application health with an intuitive web interface that celebrates good performance while highlighting areas for improvement.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add Rails Pulse to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_pulse'
```

Install the gem:

```bash
bundle install
```

Generate the installation files:

```bash
rails generate rails_pulse:install
```

Run the migrations:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

### Quick Setup

Rails Pulse automatically starts collecting performance data once installed. Access your monitoring dashboard at:

```
http://localhost:3000/rails_pulse
```

### Basic Configuration

Customize Rails Pulse in `config/initializers/rails_pulse.rb`:

```ruby
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  # Set performance thresholds
  config.response_time_thresholds = {
    fast: 100,      # ms
    moderate: 500,  # ms
    slow: 1000      # ms
  }

  # Configure query monitoring
  config.query_thresholds = {
    fast: 10,       # ms
    moderate: 50,   # ms
    slow: 100       # ms
  }

  # Set data retention (optional)
  config.data_retention_days = 30
end
```
