          Conversion complete!

          Next steps:
          1. Run: rails db:migrate
          2. Restart your Rails server

          The schema file db/rails_pulse_schema.rb remains as your single source of truth.
          Future Rails Pulse updates will come as regular migrations in db/migrate/
