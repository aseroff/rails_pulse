# Rails Pulse Performance Impact

This document outlines the performance overhead of Rails Pulse on your Rails application and provides guidance on how to measure and minimize its impact.

## Overview

Rails Pulse is designed with performance in mind, using minimal instrumentation overhead and efficient database queries. However, as with any monitoring solution, there is some measurable impact on your application's performance.

## Expected Performance Impact

Based on comprehensive benchmarking with PostgreSQL on Apple Silicon (M1/M2), here are the typical performance overheads you can expect:

### Request Processing Overhead

| Metric | Impact | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Middleware latency** | **5-6ms** per request | Includes request tracking, DB writes, and context setup |
| **Request creation** | **5.5ms** per request | Database write for request record |
| **Request + Operations** | **9.8ms** per request | Request record + SQL operation tracking |
| **Memory allocation** | **~830 KB** per request | Request + operation objects (includes DB overhead) |
| **Database writes** | **1-2 writes** per request | Request record + operations (batched when possible) |

**Important Notes:**
- The middleware overhead includes actual database writes, which dominate the latency
- In production with proper database optimization (connection pooling, indexes), overhead is typically lower
- The memory allocation is measured during object creation and is garbage collected normally
- Most of the overhead comes from persisting tracking data to the database, not instrumentation

### Background Job Tracking Overhead

| Metric | Impact | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Job execution overhead** | **< 0.1ms** per job | Negligible - tracking is nearly free |
| **Memory allocation** | **~200-300 KB** per job | Job + job run records |
| **Database writes** | **1-2 writes** per job | Job record + job run record |

### Summary Aggregation Impact

| Metric | Impact | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Hourly summary job** | **2-5 seconds** | Depends on request volume |
| **Daily cleanup job** | **5-30 seconds** | Depends on data retention settings |
| **Summary queries** | **1-20ms** per query | Grouping and aggregation queries |

## Performance Impact by Database

Rails Pulse's overhead varies by database adapter due to different write performance characteristics:

| Database | Request Overhead | Query Overhead | Notes |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| **SQLite** | Moderate (4-6ms) | Low | Good for development, limited concurrency |
| **PostgreSQL** | Moderate (5-6ms) | Low | Recommended for production with proper tuning |
| **MySQL** | Moderate (5-7ms) | Low | Good for production with proper indexes |

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use connection pooling to reduce DB connection overhead
- Ensure proper indexes exist on `occurred_at`, `route_id`, and `query_id` columns
- Consider async job processing for high-traffic applications (> 10,000 RPM)
- Use a separate database for Rails Pulse in high-traffic scenarios

## Measuring Performance Impact

Rails Pulse includes built-in benchmarking tools to help you measure the actual impact on your specific application.

### Method 1: Using Rake Tasks

**Prerequisites:**
```ruby
# Add to your application's Gemfile (development/test group)
gem 'benchmark-ips'
gem 'memory_profiler'
```

Then run:
```bash
bundle install

# Run all performance benchmarks
bundle exec rake rails_pulse:benchmark:all

# Run specific benchmarks
bundle exec rake rails_pulse:benchmark:memory
bundle exec rake rails_pulse:benchmark:request_overhead
bundle exec rake rails_pulse:benchmark:middleware
bundle exec rake rails_pulse:benchmark:job_tracking
bundle exec rake rails_pulse:benchmark:database_queries
```

### Method 2: Using the Benchmark Script

```bash
# Run comprehensive benchmarks
bundle exec ruby scripts/benchmark_performance.rb
```

This script provides detailed analysis including:
- Middleware overhead measurement
- Instrumentation hook performance
- Memory allocation analysis
- Real-world request scenario testing
- Job tracking overhead
- Rails Pulse's own query performance

### Method 3: Manual Benchmarking

You can measure Rails Pulse's impact manually using tools like Apache Bench or wrk:

```bash
# Install Apache Bench (comes with Apache)
# Or install wrk: brew install wrk

# Benchmark with Rails Pulse enabled
ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:3000/your-endpoint

# Disable Rails Pulse in your initializer
# config.enabled = false

# Benchmark with Rails Pulse disabled
ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:3000/your-endpoint

# Compare the results
```

### Method 4: Production Monitoring

Monitor your production application's performance before and after installing Rails Pulse:

```ruby
# In your application
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("process_action.action_controller") do |*args|
  event = ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event.new(*args)
  Rails.logger.info "Request duration: #{event.duration}ms"
end
```

## Minimizing Performance Impact

### 1. Configure Data Retention

Reduce database writes by configuring shorter retention periods:

```ruby
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  # Keep data for 7 days instead of 30
  config.full_retention_period = 7.days

  # Limit maximum records per table
  config.max_table_records = {
    rails_pulse_requests: 25_000,    # Reduce from 50,000
    rails_pulse_operations: 50_000,  # Reduce from 100,000
    rails_pulse_queries: 5_000       # Reduce from 10,000
  }
end
```

### 2. Ignore Asset Requests

Asset requests can generate significant noise with minimal value:

```ruby
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.track_assets = false  # Default is false
end
```

### 3. Filter Low-Value Routes

Ignore health checks, status endpoints, and other low-value routes:

```ruby
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.ignored_routes = [
    "/health",
    "/status",
    %r{^/admin/},  # Regex patterns supported
  ]
end
```

### 4. Disable Job Argument Capture

Job arguments can consume significant memory if large:

```ruby
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.capture_job_arguments = false  # Default is false
end
```

### 5. Use a Separate Database

For high-traffic applications, consider using a separate database for Rails Pulse:

```ruby
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.connects_to = {
    database: { writing: :rails_pulse, reading: :rails_pulse }
  }
end
```

This allows you to:
- Scale Rails Pulse storage independently
- Use different database engines (e.g., PostgreSQL for analytics)
- Isolate monitoring from application performance

### 6. Disable in Test Environment

Rails Pulse adds minimal value in tests:

```ruby
# config/environments/test.rb
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.enabled = false
end
```

### 7. Selectively Disable Tracking

For performance-critical code paths:

```ruby
class HighPerformanceController < ApplicationController
  def critical_action
    RailsPulse.with_tracking_disabled do
      # Performance-critical code
    end
  end
end
```

## Performance Tuning Recommendations

### For Development

```ruby
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.enabled = true
  config.full_retention_period = 3.days
  config.track_jobs = true
  config.capture_job_arguments = true  # Safe in development
end
```

### For Staging

```ruby
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.enabled = true
  config.full_retention_period = 7.days
  config.track_assets = false
  config.capture_job_arguments = false
end
```

### For Production (Low Traffic)

```ruby
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.enabled = true
  config.full_retention_period = 30.days
  config.track_assets = false
  config.ignored_routes = ["/health", "/status"]
end
```

### For Production (High Traffic)

```ruby
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.enabled = true
  config.full_retention_period = 7.days
  config.track_assets = false
  config.max_table_records = {
    rails_pulse_requests: 25_000,
    rails_pulse_operations: 50_000,
    rails_pulse_queries: 5_000
  }
  config.ignored_routes = ["/health", "/status", %r{^/admin/}]
  config.ignored_jobs = ["ActiveStorage::AnalyzeJob"]

  # Consider separate database
  config.connects_to = {
    database: { writing: :rails_pulse, reading: :rails_pulse }
  }
end
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Will Rails Pulse slow down my application?

**A:** Yes, Rails Pulse adds approximately **5-6ms per request** due to database writes for tracking data. For a typical request taking 100-500ms, this represents **1-5%** of total request time. The overhead is primarily from persisting monitoring data, not from instrumentation itself.

**Impact by request speed:**
- Fast requests (< 50ms): Overhead is more noticeable (10-12%)
- Average requests (100-500ms): Moderate impact (1-5%)
- Slow requests (> 1000ms): Minimal relative impact (< 1%)

### Q: How much memory does Rails Pulse consume?

**A:** Rails Pulse allocates approximately **~830 KB per request** during tracking (measured with full operation tracking). This memory is garbage collected after the request completes. On a server handling 1,000 requests per minute, this is roughly **830 MB/minute** of allocations, which are temporary and cleaned up by Ruby's GC.

### Q: Will the database grow indefinitely?

**A:** No. Rails Pulse includes automatic cleanup jobs that respect your retention settings. You can also set maximum record limits per table to enforce hard caps.

### Q: Should I disable Rails Pulse in production?

**A:** It depends on your traffic and performance requirements:

- **Low traffic (< 1,000 RPM):** Safe to use with default settings
- **Medium traffic (1,000-10,000 RPM):** Use with optimized settings (shorter retention, filtered routes)
- **High traffic (> 10,000 RPM):** Requires careful configuration:
  - Use separate database
  - Aggressive route filtering
  - Consider sampling (track only % of requests)
  - Shorter retention periods (3-7 days)

For very high-traffic applications, consider using Rails Pulse only in staging or with heavy sampling.

### Q: How does Rails Pulse compare to commercial APM tools?

**A:** Rails Pulse has **different tradeoffs** compared to commercial APM solutions:

**Advantages:**
- No network requests to external services
- All data stays in your control
- No monthly costs
- Detailed SQL query tracking

**Disadvantages:**
- **Higher per-request overhead** due to database writes (~5-6ms vs ~0.5-1ms for APMs)
- No distributed tracing across services
- No sophisticated error tracking integrations
- Requires database storage management

Rails Pulse is best for **debugging and development** rather than always-on production monitoring for high-traffic sites.

## Conclusion

Rails Pulse provides valuable performance insights and debugging capabilities with measurable overhead. The **~5-6ms per-request overhead** comes primarily from database writes to persist tracking data.

**When to use Rails Pulse:**
- ✅ Development and staging environments (always recommended)
- ✅ Low-traffic production sites (< 1,000 RPM)
- ✅ Medium-traffic sites with optimization (1,000-10,000 RPM)
- ✅ Debugging performance issues in production (enable temporarily)
- ⚠️  High-traffic production sites (> 10,000 RPM) - requires careful configuration

**Key recommendations:**
- Use aggressive filtering to reduce overhead (ignore assets, health checks, etc.)
- Configure shorter retention periods (7 days vs 30 days)
- Consider a separate database for Rails Pulse data
- For very high-traffic sites, consider sampling (track only 10-50% of requests)
- Monitor your own application's performance after installing Rails Pulse

The overhead is a reasonable tradeoff for the detailed insights Rails Pulse provides, especially for debugging and development. By following the optimization strategies in this guide, you can minimize impact while maintaining valuable monitoring coverage.
